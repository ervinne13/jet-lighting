Items

1. Since items in quotations do not have sizes in it, and many of the items have fixed
sizes, is it safe to assume that 1 size = 1 item code?
Ex. in the case of surface downlight: JET-LED SDL SQ 205 4.5 | 7 | 6"
    - Should we have an item code for each? (if not, we might have to change the quotation 
    details format you initially gave)
    - If each have their own item code/name they will be:
        JET-LED SDL SQ 205 4.5"
        JET-LED SDL SQ 205 7"
        JET-LED SDL SQ 205 6"
    - Note, having separate item codes may be preferable as it will be easier for us to
    tag the items and assign different prices for each sizes. This will also make it more
    consistent with other items that don't have sizes.
